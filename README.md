This script was originally made by [Jeff](https://github.com/jbachand), but was very messy and hard to setup.
This version fixed most of the issues faced with the original script.

Here are some of the changes:
* Completely new log in system
* Removed Mongo db integration
* Removed most of the Facebook integration
* Removed most of the Facebook cookies from the facebook API
* Fixed the database issues
